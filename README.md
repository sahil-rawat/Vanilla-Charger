# Vanilla-Charger
A radical approach to develop Stateful Frontends using VanillaJS *WIP*

## How??
Vanilla-Charger contains something called Helper Functions, these functions supercharge your VanillaJS to a Stateful Frontend.  
Also, these functions are fully hackable. You can tweak according to your usage or make your own functions and push to the lib for others to use it.  
This makes Vanilla-Charger boilerplate less and gives you full power over what you write.  

## TODO
1. Make stuff more user-friendly.

## Contribution
Start by forking it and using it, get some ideas, try them.  
If they're working, make a pull request with a good description, and it's done(yay).
